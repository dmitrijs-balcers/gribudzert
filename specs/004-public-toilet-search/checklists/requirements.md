# Specification Quality Checklist: Public and Accessible Toilet Search

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

**Changes Made**:
- Removed specific API references (Overpass API, OpenStreetMap) from functional requirements
- Made success criteria and assumptions technology-agnostic
- Ensured all dependencies are described in terms of capabilities, not specific technologies

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Specification successfully focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 7 measurable success criteria defined with specific metrics
- 4 user stories prioritized (2 P1, 2 P2) with clear acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases and risks properly identified with mitigation strategies
