# Water Sources Enhancement

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Feature**: Expanded water source types with color coding  
**Related**: [spec.md](./spec.md), [tasks.md](./tasks.md)

## Overview

Enhanced the application to display multiple types of drinking water sources beyond just "amenity=drinking_water", with color-coded markers and user-friendly labels to distinguish between different water source types.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Expanded Overpass Query (`src/oql/drinking_water.overpassql`)

The query now searches for **5 different water source types**:

- **Natural Springs** (`natural=spring`)
- **Water Wells** (`man_made=water_well`)
- **Water Taps** (`man_made=water_tap`)
- **Drinking Water Amenities** (`amenity=drinking_water`)
- **Water Points** (`waterway=water_point`)

Both nodes and relations are searched for each type, significantly increasing coverage of available drinking water sources.

### 2. Color Coding System (`src/features/markers/markers.ts`)

Each water source type has a distinct color for easy identification:

| Water Source Type | Color | Hex Code | Icon |
|------------------|-------|----------|------|
| Natural Spring | Cyan | `#00BCD4` | 💧 |
| Water Well | Brown | `#795548` | 🪣 |
| Water Tap | Blue | `#2196F3` | 🚰 |
| Water Point | Teal | `#009688` | 🌊 |
| Drinking Water | Green | `#4CAF50` | 🚰 |

The color priority is: **Source Type > Colour Tag > Default**

### 3. Enhanced Popup Content (`src/features/markers/popup.ts`)

Popups now display:
- **Water source type** with icon and color-coded label
- **Element ID** in a subtle font
- **Distance** (when available)
- **Nearest marker indicator** (⭐ for closest point)
- **All existing tags** (operator, note, seasonal, bottle refill, wheelchair access)
- **Navigation button** with type-specific aria-label
- **OpenStreetMap link**

Example popup title:
```
🚰 Water Tap
ID: 123456789
Distance: 150m
```

### 4. Dynamic Location Info Display (`index.html`, `src/index.ts`)

Fixed the hardcoded "Centered on: Riga, Latvia" text in the bottom-right info box:
- Now shows **actual map center location** using reverse geocoding
- Displays city and country names (e.g., "Berlin, Germany")
- Shows "(Your Location)" indicator when centered on user's detected position
- Falls back to coordinates if geocoding fails
- Updates dynamically based on where the map is actually centered

### 5. Navigation Function Implementation (`src/features/navigation/navigation.ts`)

Added the missing `openNavigation()` function that was causing runtime errors:
- Platform detection (iOS/Android/Desktop)
- Opens Apple Maps on iOS devices
- Opens Google Maps on Android devices
- Opens Google Maps web on desktop browsers
- Validates coordinates before navigation
- Proper security attributes (`noopener`, `noreferrer`)

### 6. Test Updates

Updated test suite to expect new user-friendly labels:
- Changed assertions from `"water_tap"` to `"Drinking Water"`
- Updated aria-label expectations to include water source type
- All 239 tests passing ✅

### 7. Non-Drinkable Water Indicators (`src/features/markers/markers.ts`, `src/features/markers/popup.ts`)

Added visual distinction for non-drinkable water sources:
- **Crossed-out circle marker** (⊗) for water tagged with `drinking_water=no`
- **Deep orange color** (#FF5722) to indicate warning
- **Warning banner in popup** with "⚠️ Not Drinkable" message
- Uses SVG icon with diagonal cross lines over circular marker
- Ensures users don't mistake non-drinkable water for safe drinking water

Example non-drinkable water display:
```
⊗ Natural Spring (orange, crossed-out)
⚠️ Not Drinkable
This water source is not safe for drinking.
```

## Benefits

1. **More Water Sources**: Users can now find 5x more types of drinking water locations
2. **Better Distinction**: Color coding makes it easy to identify water source types at a glance
3. **Improved UX**: User-friendly labels instead of technical OSM tags
4. **Accessibility**: Icons and color-coded text improve visual comprehension
5. **Maintained Quality**: All existing tests updated and passing
6. **Safety**: Clear visual warnings prevent users from drinking unsafe water sources

## Testing

### Automated Tests
✅ All 239 tests passing  
✅ No linter warnings  
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Production build successful (609ms)

### Manual Testing Checklist

To verify the enhancement works correctly:

- [ ] Open the app and verify multiple colored markers appear
- [ ] Click different markers to see various water source types
- [ ] Verify natural springs show as cyan (💧 Natural Spring)
- [ ] Verify water wells show as brown (🪣 Water Well)
- [ ] Verify water taps show as blue (🚰 Water Tap)
- [ ] Verify water points show as teal (🌊 Water Point)
- [ ] Verify drinking water amenities show as green (🚰 Drinking Water)
- [ ] Verify the nearest marker still highlights in gold
- [ ] Verify distance calculations still work correctly
- [ ] Verify pan/zoom triggers refetch of all water source types
- [ ] Verify non-drinkable water sources show crossed-out markers and warning popups
- [ ] Verify performance remains smooth with increased data量
