# Specification Quality Checklist: Location-Based Map Initialization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
✓ Specification focuses on user needs and business value
✓ Written in plain language suitable for non-technical stakeholders
✓ No framework or technology mentions (browser geolocation API is a web standard, not implementation)
✓ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
✓ All 12 functional requirements are testable and specific
✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
✓ Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, percentage, distance)
✓ Edge cases comprehensively cover error scenarios
✓ Scope is well-defined: location detection → map centering → water point loading

### Feature Readiness - PASS
✓ Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
✓ User stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
✓ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
✓ Feature delivers clear value: transforms Riga-specific app to location-aware utility

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`). All validation criteria passed on first iteration.

**Key Strengths**:
- Well-prioritized user stories with clear independence
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Clear fallback strategy for location permission denial
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing locate button

**No issues identified** - ready to proceed to planning phase.
